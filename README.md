# Portfolio (in React) Source

In an effort to learn new JavaScript frameworks while at the same time refining my CV/Portfolio, I have begun a process of rewriting my static [portfolio page](http://www.alexsteinberg.co.za) using various popular JavaScript frameworks.

This is the source of the React version, created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
